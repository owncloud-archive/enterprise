This is the official ownCloud image for the enterprise edition, it is built from our [base container](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/owncloud/base/). This ownCloud image is designed to work with a data volume in the host filesystem and with separate MariaDB and Redis containers.

For a guide how to get started with this Docker image please take a look at our [official documentation](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/docker/).
